<p>Hunspell prints a one-line version identification message, and then begins reading lines of input. Each word is checked for spelling. If the word was found in the dictionary, then the line contains only a ’*’. If the word was found through affix removal, then the line contains a ’+’, a space, and the root word. </p><ul><li>If the word was found through compound formation (concatenation of two words, then the line contains only a ’−’. </li><li>If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, then the line contains an ’&amp;’, a space, the misspelled word, a space, the number of near misses, the number of characters between the beginning of the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon, another space, and a list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.</li><li>Also, each near miss or guess is capitalized the same as the input word unless such capitalization is illegal; in the latter case each near miss is capitalized correctly according to the dictionary. </li><li>Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and there are no near misses, then the line contains a ’#’, a space, the misspelled word, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line. Each sentence of text input is terminated with an additional blank line, indicating that hunspell has completed processing the input line.</li></ul><p>These output lines can be summarized as follows:</p><ul><li>OK: *</li><li>Root: + &lt;root&gt;</li><li>Compound: −</li><li>Miss: &amp; &lt;original&gt; &lt;count&gt; &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;miss&gt;, &lt;miss&gt;, ...</li><li>None: # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;</li></ul><p>For example, a dummy dictionary containing the words "fray", "Frey", "fry", and "refried" might produce the following response to 'frqy refries':</p><blockquote>(#) Hunspell 0.4.1 (beta), 2005-05-26</blockquote><blockquote>&amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry</blockquote><blockquote>&amp; refries 1 5: refried</blockquote><p><br></p>
